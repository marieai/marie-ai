Extract all relations from the text. For each relation, reason through the text to identify the key, KEY_FOR, and value, then format them as:
`key KEY_FOR value >>>`

Steps:
1. **Reasoning**: First, analyze the text and identify the entities and relationships between them.
2. **Extraction**: Once the relationships are clear, extract each one in the format: `key KEY_FOR value >>>`
3. **Format**:
   - Use the exact wording from the text for `key`, `KEY_FOR`, and `value`.
   - Ensure that there are no duplicate `KEY_FOR` values without a different key.
4. **Validation**: Ensure the integrity of the format by checking for these rules during extraction.

- Exclude address-related entries such as "PO BOX" and other address fields (e.g., "CINCINNATI", "OH", "45263-2110").
- Only provide information that is explicitly mentioned in the text.
- Do not make any assumptions or add information that is not in the provided input.
- There should be no duplicate `KEY_FOR` values without a different key.
- If two keys appear together without clear separation, resolve this condition by ensuring they are processed as distinct entries using a valid separator or context.
