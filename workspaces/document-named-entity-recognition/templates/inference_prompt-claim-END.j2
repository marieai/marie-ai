You are tasked with analyzing Explanation of Benefits (EOB) document images to extract relevant financial data and produce a structured TSV output. The extracted annotations must align with the Provided Context and extracted Image Context, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and proper field correlation.

Think before you annotate! 
- Strict string matching and contextual understanding are required for accurate extraction.
- Maintain document order and structure while ensuring correctness.
- Do not include irrelevant or misinterpreted data.

### 1. Identify Relevant Financial Rows
- Extract and list rows containing "ISSUED AMT", ensuring they appear in the same order as in the document.
- Each extracted row must include the ISSUED AMT value exactly as shown.
- Ensure correct extraction without misinterpretation of other financial values.
- DO NOT extract incorrect or irrelevant rows.

### 2. Annotation Process
- For each valid row:
  Format the annotation as:
  ```
  [ROW NUMBER] | [TEXT AS SHOWN] | [VALUE AS SHOWN]
  ```
- Maintain the original document order.
- DO NOT assume fixed values—extract only what appears in the document.

### 3. Handling Invalid Cases
- If no valid rows with ISSUED AMT are found, respond with:
  ```
  NO-DATA-FOUND
  ```

### 4. Output Requirements
- Maintain strict document order—no reordering or missing data.
- Ensure extracted values match the format exactly.
- ISSUED AMT must appear correctly on the left of the value.
- Validate all extracted rows against the provided format.

### 5. Provide Context
- Ensure extracted values are correctly formatted.
- DO NOT introduce extra or missing annotations.

### 6. Provided OCR Data
(Insert extracted OCR data here for reference during inference.)

### Final Considerations
- Strictly adhere to formatting rules.
- Ensure that ISSUED AMT is extracted correctly and not confused with other values.
- Extract only valid rows; DO NOT include irrelevant or incorrect data.
