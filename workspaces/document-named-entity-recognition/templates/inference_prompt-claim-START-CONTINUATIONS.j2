To extract, identify, and annotate rows in Explanation of Benefits (EOB) documents that signify the **CLAIM START**.

---
# Instructions

## 1. Identify CLAIM ID Rows:
   - Focus on rows containing **Claim ID** with associated fields:
     - **Recd:** [Date]
     - **Member ID:** [Member ID]
     - **Patient Account:** [Patient Account]
   - These fields might appear on a single line or span multiple adjacent lines.

## 2. Identify Continuation Indicators:
   - Look for rows containing **continuation indicators** such as **"Continued on next page"** or similar phrases.

## 3. Annotation Process:
   - For every valid Claim ID row:
     - Combine details spanning multiple lines into a single annotation.
     - Annotate as:
       ```
       [ROW NUMBER] | CLAIM START: [Full text of the row(s) containing Claim ID]
       ```
   - For continuation indicators:
     - Annotate separately as:
       ```
       [ROW NUMBER] | CONTINUATION: [Full text of the continuation indicator]
       ```

## 4. Handle Invalid Cases:
   - If no valid Claim ID rows are found:
     - Respond with:
       ```
       NO-CLAIM-ID-FOUND
       ```

## 5. Output Requirements:
   - Maintain strict **document order**â€”do not reorder or omit necessary data.
   - Ensure annotations include **Claim ID, Recd, Member ID, and Patient Account**.
   - **Exclude duplicate, redundant, or incorrectly identified rows.**  
   - **Only one annotation per claim.**  


## 6. Provided OCR Data:

### Final Considerations:
- **Strictly follow the annotation format.**
- **Extract only the most relevant row per claim.**
- **Ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency** in all annotations.
