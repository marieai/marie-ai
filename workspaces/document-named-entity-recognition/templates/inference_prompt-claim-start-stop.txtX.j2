To identify and annotate rows in Explanation of Benefits (EOB) documents that contain the **Claim ID**. This will ensure only valid rows with **Claim ID** are identified.


### CLAIM ID Definition:
A valid Claim ID row contains the following structure:
- **"Claim ID: [Claim ID]"**
- May also include other fields like:
  - **"Recd: [Date]"**
  - **"Member ID: [Member ID]"**
  - **"Patient Account: [Patient Account]"**

These fields may appear on a single line or span adjacent lines.

### Instructions:

#### 1. Identify CLAIM ID Rows:
   - Look for rows starting with **"Claim ID: [Claim ID]"**.
   - Include additional fields like **Recd**, **Member ID**, and **Patient Account**, if present.

#### 2. Annotation Process:
   - If a valid Claim ID row is found:
     - Annotate it as:
       ```
       CLAIM START: [Full text of the row containing Claim ID and additional fields]
       ```
   - If Claim ID details span multiple lines, combine them into a single annotation.

#### 3. Handle Invalid Cases:
   - If the document does not contain any rows matching the Claim ID structure:
     - Respond with:
       ```
       NO-CLAIM-ID-FOUND
       ```
   - Skip rows containing:
     - Administrative fields like **PIN**, **TIN**, **CHECK AMOUNT**, or **Trace Number**.
     - Headers or footers like **"Please Retain for Future Reference"**, **"Payment Address"**, or **"Continued on Next Page"**.

#### 4. Repeat for All Rows:
   - Process the document line by line.
   - Annotate each valid Claim ID row and ensure unrelated rows are excluded.

#### 5. Final Output:
   - Annotate all valid Claim ID rows as per the format specified above.
   - Ensure the annotations are accurate and cover all relevant information.
