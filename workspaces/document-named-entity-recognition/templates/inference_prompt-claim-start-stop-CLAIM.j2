Locating CLAIM START and CLAIM END

    CLAIM START:
    Identify the beginning of each claim. A claim starts with the line containing the "Claim: [Claim Number]" (e.g., "Claim: [Claim Number]"). Include the full text of this line in your annotation.

    CLAIM END:
    Locate the last line of the claim. A claim ends with either:
        The "Column Totals" line, or
        The "End-Of-Page" marker when no clear "Column Totals" line exists.
        Include the full text of the last line in your annotation.

Instructions:

    For each claim, clearly mark the CLAIM START and CLAIM END, including the full text of the respective lines.
    Use consistent markers to annotate, such as:
        "CLAIM START: [Full text of the line]"
        "CLAIM END: [Full text of the line or "End-Of-Page"]"
    Repeat the annotation process for each claim in the document, even if the claim spans multiple pages.
