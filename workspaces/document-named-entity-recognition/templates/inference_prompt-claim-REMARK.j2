To accurately locate the **Remarks** section header and extract all the associated remarks listed below it, ensuring that the remarks are captured in their entirety.

---

# Instructions:

## 1. Locate the Remarks Header:
   - Identify the **Remarks:** header in the document.
   - Use it as a starting point for extracting associated remarks.

## 2. Extract Associated Remarks:
   - Capture all numbered remarks listed directly under the **Remarks** header.
   - Each remark typically starts with a number (e.g., **1-**, **2-**) and ends with a bracketed reference (e.g., **[M52]**, **[P80]**).
   - Ensure multiline remarks are combined into a single remark without losing any context.

## 3. Annotation Process:
   - Annotate each remark as:
     ```
     [ROW NUMBER] | REMARK_START HEADER
     [ROW NUMBER] | REMARK_DATA REMARK [NUMBER]: [Full text of the remark]
     ```

## 4. Handle Invalid Cases:
   - If the **Remarks** header is not found or there are no associated remarks:
     - Respond with:
       ```
       NO-REMARKS-FOUND
       ```

#### 5. Output Requirements:
   - Provide all extracted remarks in order.
   - Ensure remarks are complete and properly formatted.
